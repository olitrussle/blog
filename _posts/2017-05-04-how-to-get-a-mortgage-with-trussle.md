### Great news - you’ve found a home. 
No doubt finding the right mortgage will be the next thing on your mind. Trussle takes the hassle out of finding a mortgage, so you can focus on one of the most exciting times of your life. It’s quick to get started, and as we search thousands of deals from more than 90 lenders, we can make sure you find a deal that’s right for you.  

### First or fifth mortgage, Trussle can help
Whatever your position, we’re here to make it a smooth journey. If you’ve had mortgages before, you might remember a long, and at times frustrating, process - shake those memories from your mind, as with Trussle, you can look forward to a more straightforward experience.  


## How to get a mortgage with Trussle in 5 simple steps

### 1. Complete your Trussle Profile in ten minutes
We’ll ask you a few questions about your employment, any current mortgages, and personal details. The information you provide will help create what we call your Trussle Profile - this helps us establish what you’re looking for in a mortgage, so we can recommend the right deal for you.

### 2. Receive your personalised mortgage examples
We’ll send you a few examples of the types of mortgages that might be most suitable for you based on the details you’ve provided. Simply let us know if you’d like to move forward once you’ve reviewed them. 

### 3. Receive your personalised recommendation
You’ll speak to one of our friendly advisers so they can learn more about your mortgage preferences. They’ll then be able to provide you with a personalised mortgage recommendation.

### 4. Keep track of your progress from your Trussle Timeline
When you complete your Trussle Profile, you’ll be able to see your progress from your Trussle Timeline. Access your Timeline anywhere, at any time, to keep track of your application and edit your details if anything changes. 

### 5. Find out if your application has been approved
Waiting to hear whether your application has been approved can take between one day to two weeks. This varies from lender to lender, and as each application is different, it’s impossible to give a concrete timeframe. As soon as we hear from the lender, we’ll be in touch by email to share the news! 


## What happens next?

### When is my mortgage ready to start? 
Once your mortgage has been approved, the legal work is all that’s left to go through. At this point your solicitor will get in touch with you to confirm the next steps, and will send you the relevant documents to fill in. Before your purchase can exchange and complete, your solicitor will make contact with the seller’s solicitor to raise enquiries. They’ll also submit the necessary searches involved.                            

A completion date will be agreed between all parties involved. Upon completion, once you’ve exchanged and you become the legal owner of your new home, your mortgage is ready to start. 

## Your application with Trussle

### Things you’ll need to create your application
You’ll probably be able to answer the questions without needing anything to hand. However, if you have a mortgage already and aren’t sure of the details (we’ll ask you the start date, length and type of mortgage), you’ll have to dig out your documents. 

### Uploading your documents
You’ll need to upload a few documents for the lender to verify once you’re ready to send your application. Find out [which documents you need to apply for a mortgage](https://trussle.com/blog/what-documents-do-you-need-for-a-mortgage "DocumentsMortgage"). 

### Your Trussle Timeline
Your Trussle Timeline shows the status of your application, making it easy to keep up-to-date with any progress.

### Will I have a face-to-face meeting to discuss my mortgage?
One of the benefits of using Trussle is the speed at which you can apply for a mortgage. We’ve cut out the need for a time-consuming and unnecessary face-to-face meeting - we can provide you with all the advice and support you need online, saving you time and hassle. 

## Helpful mortgage information 

### Types of mortgage
We’ll ask which type of mortgage you’d like, but if you’re not sure yet, don’t panic - that’s what we’re here for. We’ll search the deals to find those most suitable for your situation. If you already know the type of mortgage you’d like, that’s great - we’ll check the rest of the information you give to make sure you’re not missing out on anything better.

## Advice from the expert

Trussle mortgage adviser, Deeksha, thinks getting mortgage advice is vital before making a decision.  > "With so many different mortgages to choose from, it can be hard to know which is right for you. Variable rates look appealing at the moment because the base rate is so low, but it’s only wise to choose a variable rate if you could afford to pay more should the interest rate rise.”

> “Make sure you understand the mortgage deals available as well as the costs associated before making a decision. Getting advice from a mortgage adviser like Trussle is important, as they’ll look at your personal circumstances to help you decide which to go for.”
