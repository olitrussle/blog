Ahmed has worked outside of London for five years, but decided the commute to Shoreditch to join Trussle would be worth it - even if it means getting on a train every morning rather than enjoying the comfort of his car. 





## What made you want to join Trussle?
I love the fact that Trussle is a new business doing exciting things and growing quickly. There was a barrier to progression in my previous role and it wasn’t easy to grow or learn easily. At Trussle, I can learn from lots of different people, sharing ideas and developing my skillset. I can see myself doing a number of different things here over the next few years, whereas in my old job I could see myself in the same office, at the same desk, doing the same things in ten years time. There’s not a chance of that here! 

## Where were you working before?
I was working for an estate agency based broker firm covering the Surrey area, mainly Staines and Sunbury. I live in Slough so it meant I could drive everywhere I needed to be which was the main benefit! I’ve tried to put off commuting into central London for as long as possible - I’ve driven to every job I’ve ever had, but I knew at some point I’d have to bite the bullet! This opportunity arose and it’s worth the commute, which will be ever better by the time Crossrail comes in.

## What do you get up to in your spare time?
I play football twice a week, and I like watching films and going to the cinema. My favourite film is Shawshank Redemption. 

## What excites you most about Trussle?
The whole journey. I like the fact that Trussle’s a new and exciting company so there’s more opportunity to get involved with how the company is going to look as it grows. Unlike older companies, not everything’s set in stone. I’m excited to be on that journey.

## Favourite food?
I’m a bit of a foodie so it’s a tough one... But steak. 

## Best thing about your job?
The people I work with. Also the fact that everyone’s very integrated - there’s a big focus on teamwork and everyone is happy to help each other. 

## How did you get into mortgage advising?
I randomly fell into it. I studied Economics at university in Kingston but didn’t know what I wanted to do when I finished. I knew I wanted to work in finance, and I had an interest in property, so mortgage advising was a good fit. Kingston uni emailed me with a few job opportunities, I went for one of them, and it went from there!
